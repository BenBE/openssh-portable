This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to
external libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features
reintroduced and many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH has been created by
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song. It has a homepage at http://www.openssh.com/
=======
Handshake obfuscation strengthens the initial SSH handshake against systems
that identify or classify various network protocols by examining data in 
transit for static signatures.  Such automatic classification of traffic is 
often used to provide different levels of network service for each protocol
and sometimes used to implement policies which prohibit certain uses of a
network.

When an SSH connection is initiated, the client and server exchange several
packets to configure the cryptographic parameters for the session.  Since
the encryption algorithms and keys have not yet been determined, this exchange
of messages is not encrypted and is vulnerable to analysis which can conclusively
identify the connection as SSH protocol traffic no matter what port the server
is listening on.  For most users this is of no concern, because merely being
able to identify a connection as an SSH session does not introduce any security
vulnerabilities in the protocol itself.

Some users may have special security needs where they would prefer not to 
disclose that they are using the SSH protocol to somebody who may be monitoring
the network.  Handshake obfuscation prevents automatic identification of SSH
protocol traffic by encrypting the entire handshake with a stream cipher, and 
is designed to make it difficult to implement an automated analysis tool even
understanding how the obfuscation protocol works. 

The obfuscation encryption key is generated in a way which is deliberately 
slow to make it difficult to implement on the type of high performance network
hardware which is usually used for classifying protocol traffic.  Additionally
an option is provided for the client and server to share a 'keyword' which is
a simple kind of password that is used only for securing the handshake.  No
connection can be initiated to a server which has keyword obfuscation enabled 
without knowing the keyword, and the obfuscation keyword is used to derive the
keys that encrypt the handshake in order prevent decrypting the handshake 
traffic without knowing the keyword.


>>>>>>> Some documentation improvements

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support, EGD[1]/PRNGD[2] support and replacements for OpenBSD library
functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port
has been best tested on AIX, Cygwin, HP-UX, Linux, MacOS/X,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenServer, Solaris, Unicos, and UnixWare.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[3], OpenSSL[4] and optionally PAM[5].

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to http://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to the mailing list
openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org. The list is open to posting by
unsubscribed users.Code contribution are welcomed, but please follow the 
OpenBSD style guidelines[6].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on how to install
OpenSSH on your system. There are a number of differences between this
port of OpenSSH and F-Secure SSH 1.x, please refer to the OpenSSH FAQ[7]
for details and general tips.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD
CVS repository which in turn was based on the last free sample
implementation released by Tatu Ylonen.
